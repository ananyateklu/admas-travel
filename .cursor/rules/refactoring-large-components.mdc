## Large Component Refactoring Guidelines
- These files have been identified as excessively large and complex
- Follow these guidelines when modifying or refactoring them

## Identified Large Components
- `Admin.tsx` (1191 lines)
- `FlightBookingsList.tsx` (661 lines)
- `HotelBookingsList.tsx` (513 lines)
- `CarBookingsList.tsx` (522 lines)
- `Account.tsx` (726 lines)

## Refactoring Strategies
- Extract logical sections into separate component files
- Move complex data processing to custom hooks
- Separate UI rendering from data manipulation
- Break down large functions into smaller, focused functions
- Extract reusable UI patterns to shared components
- Use composition to combine smaller components

## Component Division Guidelines
- Identify logical UI sections that can be extracted
- Look for repeated patterns that could be consolidated
- Identify stateful logic that could be moved to hooks
- Consider using context for deeply shared state
- Maintain consistent naming conventions for new components

## Testing Considerations
- Ensure functionality remains the same after refactoring
- Add tests for extracted components
- Verify all user interactions continue to work
- Test edge cases specifically
