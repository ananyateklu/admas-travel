## Feature-Specific Guidelines

- Ensure proper date handling with functions from `dateUtils.ts`
- Follow the established UX flow for the booking process
- Maintain consistent error handling throughout the feature
- Reuse common components for UI consistency

## State Management
- Use React Context for flight search parameters
