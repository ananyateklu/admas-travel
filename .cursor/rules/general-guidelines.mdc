## Project Overview

- Use functional components with React hooks
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

## File Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., `FlightBook.tsx`)
- Use camelCase for utility files (e.g., `dateUtils.ts`)
- Group related files in appropriate directories

## Imports Organization

- Third-party library imports second
- Local component imports third
- Utility/helper imports fourth
- Style imports last

## Component Structure
- Props interface defined at the top of the file
